Development
-----------

If you've got PhantomJS (>1.5.0) on your path, then:

$ make test

should show you that everything is ready to go.

To run a development server:

$ make run

then visit http://localhost:3000/ to play with the app, or
http://localhost:3000/test/ to run the tests in the browser.

To have fun doing test-driven development:

$ make watch

and tests will run on each change, with Ubuntu OSD notifications.
